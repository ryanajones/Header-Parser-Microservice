# Header Parser Microservice

Adding `/api/whoami` onto the base URL and sending the GET request will return a JSON response of the user's IP address, system's preferred language, and software information. Node and Express are used to implement a RESTful API to handle HTTP requests. Within the route handler function, the information is parsed from the request header object and returned to the front-end.
