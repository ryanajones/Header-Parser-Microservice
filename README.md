# Header Parser Microservice

Adding `/api/whoami` onto the base URL and sending will return a JSON response of the user's system information. Included in the response will be the user's IP address, prefered language, and software information. Node and Express are used to implement a RESTful API to handle the HTTP GET requests. Within the route handler function, the information is pulled from the request object and returned to the front-end.
